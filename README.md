# Budget App

## Introduction
Budget App is made up of a series of budget category objects e.g. food, clothing and entertainment. Each object has a deposit, withdraw, get_balance, transfer and check_funds method. While methods are performed on these objects, a ledger keeps track of them and can display the current state of all categories.
